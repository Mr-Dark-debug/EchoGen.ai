# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical issues preventing proper podcast generation and playback in the EchoGen.ai Flutter application. The current implementation has fundamental problems with Gemini TTS API integration, audio format handling, and media player compatibility that result in podcasts either failing to generate or being unplayable when generated.

The goal is to create a reliable, user-friendly podcast generation and playback system that consistently produces high-quality audio content from text scripts using AI-powered text-to-speech technology.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reliable Podcast Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate podcasts from my scripts using AI voices, so that I can create engaging audio content consistently and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates podcast generation with valid script and voice selections THEN the system SHALL successfully generate an audio file within 2 minutes for scripts up to 5000 words
2. WHEN the Gemini TTS API is called THEN the system SHALL properly format the request according to Gemini's multi-speaker TTS specification
3. WHEN the TTS API returns audio data THEN the system SHALL correctly process the PCM audio response and convert it to a playable WAV format
4. WHEN podcast generation encounters an error THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages to the user
5. WHEN the API key is invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL display specific instructions for obtaining and configuring the correct API key
6. WHEN generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL show accurate progress indicators and prevent app backgrounding from interrupting the process

### Requirement 2: Compatible Audio Playback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to play generated podcasts within the app using intuitive controls, so that I can immediately listen to and evaluate my created content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a podcast is generated THEN the system SHALL create an audio file that is immediately playable in the app's media player
2. WHEN the user taps the play button THEN the audio SHALL start playing within 2 seconds with proper audio controls
3. WHEN audio is playing THEN the system SHALL display accurate progress indicators, time remaining, and playback controls
4. WHEN the user adjusts playback speed THEN the system SHALL maintain audio quality while changing speed from 0.5x to 2.0x
5. WHEN the user seeks to different positions THEN the system SHALL accurately jump to the requested time position
6. WHEN playback encounters an error THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and recovery options
7. WHEN the app is backgrounded during playback THEN the audio SHALL continue playing with proper background audio session management

### Requirement 3: Proper Audio Format Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want my generated podcasts to be in standard audio formats that work across different devices and players, so that I can share and use my content anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives PCM audio data from Gemini TTS THEN it SHALL convert the data to a properly formatted WAV file with correct headers
2. WHEN generating audio files THEN the system SHALL embed proper metadata including title, duration, and creation date
3. WHEN saving audio files THEN the system SHALL use standard file extensions and MIME types for maximum compatibility
4. WHEN the user downloads a podcast THEN the system SHALL provide the audio in a format playable by standard media players
5. WHEN audio format conversion fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative formats or provide clear error messages
6. WHEN validating audio files THEN the system SHALL verify file integrity before attempting playback

### Requirement 4: Robust Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about what's happening during podcast generation and helpful error messages when things go wrong, so that I can understand and resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs during podcast generation THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with specific next steps
2. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform the user about rate limiting and suggest retry timing
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect the problem and suggest checking internet connection
4. WHEN the API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step instructions for obtaining and configuring a valid key
5. WHEN generation is taking longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress updates and estimated time remaining
6. WHEN the user attempts to cancel generation THEN the system SHALL safely stop the process and clean up temporary files
7. WHEN audio playback fails THEN the system SHALL offer alternative playback methods or file export options

### Requirement 5: Optimized File Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my generated podcasts to be properly saved and organized, so that I can easily access, manage, and share my audio content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a podcast is generated THEN the system SHALL save it to the user's preferred storage location with proper permissions
2. WHEN saving files THEN the system SHALL use descriptive filenames based on the podcast title and generation timestamp
3. WHEN storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL warn the user and provide options to free up space
4. WHEN the user wants to download a podcast THEN the system SHALL copy the file to an accessible location like Downloads folder
5. WHEN managing podcast files THEN the system SHALL provide options to delete, rename, or share individual podcasts
6. WHEN the app is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL ensure user-generated content is preserved in accessible locations
7. WHEN temporary files are created during generation THEN the system SHALL clean them up after successful completion or failure

### Requirement 6: Multi-Speaker Voice Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select different AI voices for different speakers in my podcast, so that I can create engaging conversations with distinct character voices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting voices THEN the system SHALL display all available Gemini TTS voices with clear descriptions of their characteristics
2. WHEN configuring speakers THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of different voices to Speaker 1 and Speaker 2
3. WHEN generating multi-speaker content THEN the system SHALL properly map speaker names in the script to the selected voices
4. WHEN voice selection is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide fallback voice options and inform the user
5. WHEN previewing voices THEN the system SHALL allow users to hear sample audio for each voice option
6. WHEN saving voice preferences THEN the system SHALL remember the user's preferred voice combinations for future use

### Requirement 7: Audio Quality and Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want my generated podcasts to have high audio quality and reasonable generation times, so that I can create professional-sounding content efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating podcasts THEN the system SHALL produce audio with clear speech quality suitable for listening
2. WHEN processing long scripts THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent audio quality throughout the entire podcast
3. WHEN generating audio THEN the system SHALL complete the process within reasonable time limits (under 3 minutes for typical scripts)
4. WHEN the user's device has limited resources THEN the system SHALL optimize processing to prevent app crashes or freezing
5. WHEN multiple generation requests are made THEN the system SHALL queue them appropriately and prevent resource conflicts
6. WHEN audio quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL offer regeneration options or quality adjustment settings
